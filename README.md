# mullinx
μllinx (mullinx) is a simple, unobtrusive widget and jQuery plugin used to transform normal hyperlinks into multidirectional hyperlinks through the flexibility of jQuery's selector.

Links are considered the primary navigational means of the web and the main essence of hypertextual technology. They are often used as unidirectional vectors, μllinx's main aim is to transform unidirectional links to multi-headed links, without big efforts for web authors.
